Online quiz about the Premier League season 24/25
=================================================================
Project description
-------------------
As part of my Codecademy FrontEndPlus course i was tasked with designed a website for an online quiz, as a football fan i decided to do one on the 24/25 football season.

The Webpage was designed using four HTML pages, one CSS page and three Javascript pages. There are also a number of images in the file.

The quiz is designed so that there is one question for each of the teams that played in the season, 20 questions total, each question is randomly selected but only shown once, you have to answer the question to move onto the next question. Each teams question should have a background colour that represents that teams home kit for the season. After every four questions the user gets right a pop up window will appear with a 'you scored' message, the same applies for four wrong answers with a 'computer scored' message. The results are tallied up at the end of the quiz and a scoreboard is shown with the result, there are 11 different outcomes depinding on the user answers. 

The webpage should open up on the home page with an image and a couple of headers above a button with the text 'To Warm Up', when this button is clicked the user should be moved onto the instructions page which explains the rules of the game, you can start the quiz by clicking the 'Kick Off' button. The quiz will begin with the first randomly selected question, once answereed by clicking on one of the four buttons an explanation will be given for the answer, correct answers will go green, incorrect answers will show red. After all 20 questions have been answered a full time screen will appear with a check your score button, this will lead to the results page where your score will be shown and a comment. There is a back to home page button on this screen.

There is a leave quiz button at the bottom of each question, if this is clicked you return to the home page and your score will be reset.

How to Install and Run
----------------------
You cabn download the code by clicking the green code button and copying the link in the box, i worked on this project with VS Code, i believe this should be transferable to other software. You can also run the webpage by entering the following link into your browser - https://jamie-kaemmnitz.github.io/prem-quiz-24-25/

Known Bugs

Currently having issues with the webpage design with samsung mobile, the webpage crashes when scrolling - stops buttons from wroking, the layout is off with certain elements overlapping and running off the screen, this only seems to be an issue with samsung browsers. Currently working on a solution.
